# Work Day Scheduler

## Weekly Project #5

Use this website to plan out your work day.

Click a box next to an hour of the workday to add tasks for the day. Then, click the save icon to save those tasks for later! Come back to the website later, and all your tasks will be ready and waiting for you.

This website uses JavaScript to dynamically edit HTML elements to display necessary information to the user. This site also uses Luxon (rather than moment.js) to keep track of the time throughout the day. jQuery is used to set and manipulate element information. LocalStorage is used to store information between sessions.
